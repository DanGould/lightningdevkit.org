<p>Integrate payjoin into any Bitcoin wallet</p>

<div class="feature">
<h3>PSBT Purity</h3>

Standard PSBT support and an internet connection is all you need to payjoin. No fancy transaction parsing or wallet architechture required.

<div class="feature">
<h3>Sans IO</h3>

The library is perfectly IO-agnosticâ€”in fact, it does no IO. The primary goal of such design is to be easy to unit test. As a bonus, it can run almost anywhere.

<div class="feature">
<h3>Use any Runtime</h3>

We don't choose whether you use `async`, blocking, `tokio`, `sync-std`, `hyper`, `actix` or whatever. Use what you're already comfortable with. See [examples](/examples/) for a number of reference implementations.

<div class="feature">
<h3>Multi-Language Support</h3>

We are building native APIs for Rust, C, Python, Swift, JavaScript, Java & Kotlin so you can build Payjoin applications in your preferred programming language.
